                </h3>

                <p>As the staff editor for Annenberg Media Center&#39;s special projects desk, I have encouraged students to innovate beyond using social media to tell breaking news stories to develop features for Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat and other social formats. In this instance, students wanted to celebrate Black History month by acknowledging the accomplishments of their predecessors at USC. They combined traditional reporting skills, including finding archival photographs, with a newer medium.</p>

                <p>As a piece of service journalism, special projects sought to simplify the platforms of the various candidates for student government offices. We compared similar interactives from professional news organizations and built this page as simply as possible, allowing students to code the page themselves.</p>
